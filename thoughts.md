Takeaways from first few classes:
  1. Coding can be fun; you just need to make sure that you're clean and concise with said code.
  2. Familiarity with hotkeys is familiarity with moving quickly; the more familiar you are with your hotkeys, the easier you'll find it to navigate quickly.

Two new strategies I am committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0
  1. Be sure to use excellent git commit messages; Make sure the nightmares of git commit messages stay in the past!
  2. Use hotkeys wherever I possibly can; hotkeys are so so SO important!

I must give a huge shoutout to two wonderful individuals; Devin Pile for supporting everyone in the mod 0 group, and Nick Nist (absolutely wonderful alumni) for being a constant support during my time at Turing thus far.
